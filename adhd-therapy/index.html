          <h2>Understanding ADHD in Women and Girls</h2>
          <p>ADHD in women and girls is one of the most underdiagnosed and misunderstood conditions in mental health. For decades, ADHD research and diagnostic criteria were built around how symptoms present in boys — hyperactivity, impulsivity, disruption in the classroom. But ADHD in women often looks very different.</p>
          <p>Instead of bouncing off the walls, you may have spent your life struggling silently: losing track of time, feeling overwhelmed by daily tasks, battling an inner restlessness that no one else can see, or working twice as hard as everyone around you just to keep up. Many women with ADHD were told they were "too sensitive," "not living up to their potential," or "just needed to try harder."</p>
          <p>If you were diagnosed later in life — or suspect you may have ADHD — you are not alone. And there is nothing wrong with you. Your brain simply works differently, and with the right support, that difference can become a source of strength.</p>

          <h2>How ADHD Shows Up in Your Life</h2>
          <p>ADHD is far more than difficulty focusing. It touches every area of your life — your relationships, your work, your self-image, and your emotional wellbeing. You may recognize yourself in some of these experiences:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Difficulty focusing and following through</strong> — starting projects with excitement but struggling to finish them, or losing track of important details</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional flooding</strong> — feeling emotions intensely and having difficulty regulating reactions, especially under stress</li>
            <li><strong>Chronic overwhelm</strong> — the weight of daily responsibilities feels heavier than it should, and you are constantly running behind</li>
            <li><strong>Shame and self-criticism</strong> — years of struggling have built a painful inner narrative that you are lazy, broken, or not enough</li>
            <li><strong>Perfectionism as compensation</strong> — overworking, over-planning, and holding yourself to impossible standards to mask the chaos underneath</li>
            <li><strong>Executive function challenges</strong> — difficulty with time management, organization, prioritizing, and initiating tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship strain</strong> — misunderstandings, forgotten commitments, and emotional reactivity that impact your connections with partners, family, and friends</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who I Help</h2>
          <p>At Alynne Davis, PLLC, I understand the complexities of ADHD across different stages of life and different types of relationships. I offer holistic ADHD therapy for:</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Women with ADHD</h3>
            <p>Whether you were recently diagnosed or have known for years, therapy can help you understand your brain, build self-compassion, and develop strategies that actually work for how you think and process the world.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Teens (16+) with ADHD</h3>
            <p>Adolescence is already a time of intense change. Adding ADHD to the mix can make school, friendships, and identity development feel impossibly hard. I help teens build confidence, develop coping skills, and understand that their brain is not a problem to be fixed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Families Navigating ADHD</h3>
            <p>When one or more family members have ADHD, the entire family system is affected. Family therapy helps everyone understand ADHD, improve communication, reduce conflict, and build a home environment that supports every member.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Couples and ADHD</h3>
            <p>ADHD can create unique challenges in romantic relationships — from forgotten plans to emotional dysregulation to feeling like your partner doesn't understand you. Couples therapy helps both partners develop empathy, communication tools, and shared strategies for a stronger relationship.</p>

    <!-- Holistic Approach -->
    <section class="section section-warm">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>A Holistic Approach to ADHD Treatment</h2>
          <p>I believe that managing ADHD requires more than behavioral strategies and medication management. My approach addresses the whole person — your mind, body, emotions, and creative spirit — so that you can build a life that works <em>with</em> your brain, not against it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-grid fade-in">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Expressive Arts Therapy</h3>
            <p>Creative modalities like painting, collage, movement, and journaling are naturally engaging for the ADHD brain. Expressive arts therapy harnesses that creative energy for emotional processing, self-discovery, and building new neural pathways for regulation and focus.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Mindfulness and Somatic Awareness</h3>
            <p>Learning to notice what is happening in your body and mind — without judgment — is a powerful tool for managing ADHD. I teach practical, ADHD-friendly mindfulness techniques that help you slow down, regulate your nervous system, and respond rather than react.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Nutrition Support</h3>
            <p>What you eat directly affects how your brain functions. I incorporate nutrition awareness into treatment to help you understand how food impacts focus, mood, energy, and emotional regulation — and to build sustainable habits that support your neurological needs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Personalized Assessments</h3>
            <p>Every brain is different. I begin with a thorough assessment to understand your unique ADHD profile, strengths, challenges, and goals. From there, we build a tailored treatment plan designed around your specific needs and life circumstances.</p>

    <!-- ADHD and Burnout -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>ADHD and Burnout in Women</h2>
          <p>Women with ADHD are particularly vulnerable to burnout. Years of masking symptoms, compensating with perfectionism, and carrying the invisible mental load of managing a household, career, and relationships take a profound toll.</p>
          <p>Burnout from ADHD is not the same as being tired. It is a deep depletion — emotional, physical, and cognitive — that comes from spending your life operating in a world that was not designed for your brain. You may feel like you have hit a wall, lost your motivation, or can no longer keep up the facade that everything is fine.</p>
          <p>Therapy can help you recognize the patterns that led to burnout, rebuild your energy and capacity, and create a life with more realistic expectations, better boundaries, and genuine self-compassion.</p>

    <!-- ADHD and Eating Disorders -->
    <section class="section section-warm">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>The Connection Between ADHD and Eating Disorders</h2>
          <p>Research increasingly shows a significant link between ADHD and disordered eating. Impulsivity, difficulty with emotional regulation, sensory sensitivities, and the need for stimulation can all contribute to patterns like binge eating, restrictive eating, or a complicated relationship with food and body image.</p>
          <p>For women, the intersection of ADHD and eating disorders is often compounded by societal pressure to be thin, organized, and in control — the very things that feel hardest when you have ADHD. The shame cycle can be relentless.</p>
          <p>As a therapist who specializes in both <a href="/eating-disorder-therapist" title="Eating disorder therapy in Charlotte, NC">eating disorders</a> and ADHD, I understand how these conditions interact and reinforce each other. Treatment addresses both together, so you can heal the root causes rather than just managing surface-level symptoms.</p>

    <!-- Building Self-Compassion -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>Building Self-Compassion and Reducing Shame</h2>
          <p>If you have ADHD, you have likely spent a lifetime collecting evidence for the story that something is wrong with you. Every forgotten appointment, missed deadline, emotional outburst, and unfinished project has reinforced a belief that you are fundamentally flawed.</p>
          <p>One of the most important aspects of ADHD therapy is dismantling that shame. Together, we work on understanding that your struggles are not character flaws — they are symptoms of a neurological difference that was never properly supported. As you develop a compassionate relationship with yourself and your brain, everything else begins to shift: your confidence, your relationships, your ability to ask for what you need, and your willingness to stop performing for a world that never made space for you.</p>
          <p>You are not too much. You are not not enough. You are a whole person who deserves support that actually fits.</p>
