            <h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
            <p>Weekly 50-minute sessions — the foundation of our work together. We'll use a blend of CBT, Internal Family Systems, and somatic awareness to address the patterns, beliefs, and experiences that are keeping you stuck.</p>

        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>Specializations</h2>
          <p>My clinical work is focused on the issues that most deeply affect women — and that require specialized training, not just general talk therapy. I bring more than nine years of clinical experience to each of these areas.</p>

          <div class="services-list">
            <h3>Eating Disorders</h3>
            <p>Specialized treatment for binge eating disorder, bulimia, ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), orthorexia, and disordered eating patterns. I understand the complexity of food, control, and identity — and I approach recovery with both clinical expertise and deep compassion.</p>

            <h3>Trauma and PTSD</h3>
            <p>Trauma-informed therapy for women navigating the effects of childhood experiences, relational trauma, complex PTSD, and adverse life events. We work at a pace that honors your nervous system and builds genuine safety from the inside out.</p>

            <h3>ADHD in Women</h3>
            <p>ADHD in women is frequently undiagnosed or masked by anxiety, perfectionism, and people-pleasing. I help women understand their ADHD, develop self-compassion, and build strategies that work with their brain rather than against it.</p>

            <h3>Body Image</h3>
            <p>Healing your relationship with your body is central to healing your relationship with yourself. I support women in moving from chronic self-monitoring and body shame toward embodiment, acceptance, and trust.</p>

            <h3>Perinatal Mood Disorders</h3>
            <p>Pregnancy and postpartum bring enormous emotional shifts that deserve specialized support. I work with women experiencing perinatal anxiety, depression, and the identity changes that come with becoming a mother.</p>

            <h3>Life Transitions</h3>
            <p>Career changes, relationship shifts, loss, identity questions, and the quiet crises that don't always have a name — I support women through the transitions that shake the ground beneath them and help them find solid footing again.</p>

            <h3>Women's Mental Health</h3>
            <p>From perfectionism and burnout to self-worth and relational patterns, I understand the unique pressures women face. My practice offers a space to process, heal, and grow without performing or pretending.</p>

          <h2>Session Details and Logistics</h2>

          <h3>In-Person and Virtual Options</h3>
          <p>I offer both in-person sessions at my Charlotte, NC office and virtual therapy sessions for clients located anywhere in <strong>North Carolina</strong> and <strong>South Carolina</strong>. Virtual sessions are conducted through a secure, HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform, providing the same quality of care from the comfort of your own space.</p>

          <h3>Insurance and Payment</h3>
          <p>I am an out-of-network provider. This means I do not bill insurance directly, but I can provide a superbill (detailed receipt) that you can submit to your insurance company for potential out-of-network reimbursement. Many clients are surprised to find they receive significant reimbursement through their plans.</p>
          <p>I accept payment via credit card, debit card, and HSA/FSA cards. Payment is due at the time of each session.</p>
          <p>If cost is a concern, I encourage you to reach out. I want to make sure the right support is accessible to you.</p>

          <h3>Getting Started</h3>
          <p>The first step is a free 15-minute phone consultation. During this call, you'll have the opportunity to share a bit about what you're going through, ask any questions, and get a sense of whether my approach feels right for you. From there, we'll schedule your first full session and begin.</p>
