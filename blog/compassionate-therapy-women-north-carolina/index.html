          <p>Are you feeling stuck in cycles of self-criticism, burnout, or body shame? Do you long to feel at home in your own skin — confident, calm, and truly yourself?</p>

          <p>If so, you're not alone — and you've come to the right place.</p>

          <p>I provide a safe, supportive space for women and teens navigating eating disorders, life transitions, and the emotional weight of trauma. Whether you're struggling with an eating disorder, processing a difficult life change, or simply feeling disconnected from yourself, I'm here to walk alongside you on your healing journey.</p>

          <h2>A Holistic, Evidence-Based Approach</h2>

          <p>With over 9 years of clinical experience, I bring a unique blend of evidence-based and creative therapeutic approaches to my work with women across North Carolina. My practice integrates cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness with expressive arts therapy — creating a therapeutic experience that addresses not just the mind, but the body and spirit as well.</p>

          <p>I believe that healing happens when we honor every part of who we are. That's why my approach goes beyond traditional talk therapy to include creative expression, somatic awareness, and nutritional understanding — because you deserve care that sees the whole you.</p>

          <h2>How I Can Help You Heal</h2>

          <h3>Eating Disorders</h3>

          <p>Eating disorders are complex, deeply personal struggles that affect every area of your life. Whether you're navigating binge eating disorder, bulimia, ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), orthorexia, or another form of disordered eating, I provide specialized, compassionate treatment that addresses the root causes — not just the symptoms.</p>

          <p>Together, we'll work to rebuild your relationship with food and your body, understand the emotional patterns that drive disordered eating, and develop sustainable strategies for nourishment and self-care. You don't have to white-knuckle your way through recovery. There is a gentler path.</p>

          <h3>Women's Mental Health</h3>

          <p>Women face unique mental health challenges that are often minimized or overlooked. I specialize in supporting women through:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Perinatal transitions:</strong> The journey into motherhood — including pregnancy, postpartum, and the often unspoken grief of pregnancy loss — brings profound emotional shifts that deserve skilled, compassionate support.</li>
            <li><strong>Menopause:</strong> Hormonal changes can trigger or intensify anxiety, depression, identity shifts, and body image concerns. You deserve a therapist who understands these transitions as more than "just hormones."</li>
            <li><strong>Identity loss:</strong> Whether it's becoming a mother, navigating an empty nest, ending a relationship, or questioning who you are beyond your roles — the loss of identity is real, valid, and deserving of dedicated therapeutic attention.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Anxiety, Depression, and Trauma</h3>

          <p>Anxiety and depression rarely exist in isolation. They're often connected to unprocessed trauma, perfectionism, chronic stress, or relational wounds that have accumulated over time. Using a trauma-informed approach, I help you understand the origins of your distress, regulate your nervous system, and build resilience — not by pushing through, but by learning to be present with yourself in a new way.</p>

          <h3>Life Transitions</h3>

          <p>Change — even positive change — can be profoundly destabilizing. I work with women navigating:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Divorce and relationship changes:</strong> Rebuilding your sense of self after the end of a significant relationship.</li>
            <li><strong>Career shifts:</strong> Managing the anxiety, grief, and excitement that come with professional reinvention.</li>
            <li><strong>Empty nest:</strong> Finding purpose and identity when the daily rhythms of parenting shift dramatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Relocation and new beginnings:</strong> Building community and grounding yourself when everything around you is new.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Work With Me</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>8+ years of specialized experience:</strong> I've dedicated my career to understanding the unique mental health needs of women and teens, with particular expertise in eating disorders and trauma.</li>
            <li><strong>Trauma-informed and holistic:</strong> Every aspect of my practice is designed to create safety, choice, and empowerment. I meet you where you are — never pushing, always supporting.</li>
            <li><strong>A unique blend of talk therapy, nutrition, and creative expression:</strong> My integrative approach means you get more than one pathway to healing. We'll use conversation, art, movement, journaling, and nutritional awareness to support your whole-person recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>A safe, nonjudgmental space:</strong> Whatever you're carrying — shame, fear, grief, confusion — you can bring it here. There is nothing you can say that will make me see you as less than worthy of compassion and care.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>You Are Not Broken</h2>

          <p>I want you to hear this clearly: <strong>You are not broken. You are not alone. Healing is possible.</strong></p>

          <p>Whatever you've been through, however long you've been struggling, it is not too late to begin again. You deserve a life that feels like yours — a life where you feel grounded in your body, connected to your emotions, and free to be authentically, unapologetically yourself.</p>

          <h3>Get in Touch</h3>

          <p>If you're ready to take the first step, I'd love to hear from you. You can reach me at:</p>
