          <p>I've always believed that healing isn't about being "fixed." It's about coming home — to your body, your voice, your truth.</p>

          <p>Over the years, I've had the honor of sitting with hundreds of women in therapy — women navigating eating disorders, trauma, perfectionism, burnout, and the quiet devastation of losing themselves inside their roles and relationships. And again and again, I heard the same things:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><em>"I feel like I've lost myself."</em></p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <p><em>"I can't turn my mind off."</em></p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <p><em>"I'm exhausted from pretending I'm okay."</em></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>These weren't women who lacked intelligence, strength, or resilience. These were smart, compassionate, deeply resilient women. But they were burned out from perfectionism, frozen in people-pleasing, and silenced by shame. They had spent so long taking care of everyone else that they had lost touch with themselves — their needs, their desires, their creative spark, their truth.</p>

          <p>And I knew that the work we were doing together in individual therapy was powerful — but I also knew that not every woman could access weekly one-on-one sessions. I wanted to create something that could reach more women, something that could meet them wherever they were.</p>

          <h2>Why Traditional Talk Therapy Wasn't Enough</h2>

          <p>Don't get me wrong — talk therapy is incredibly valuable. But here's what I've learned after years of clinical practice: talk therapy lives in the head. And many women who carry trauma, perfectionism, or chronic self-abandonment already live there too much.</p>

          <p>They can intellectualize their patterns. They can explain why they people-please or restrict or overwork. They can articulate the childhood wounds that shaped their beliefs. But knowing isn't the same as feeling. Understanding isn't the same as healing.</p>

          <p>I needed something more. Something creative. Something embodied. Something soulful.</p>

          <p>So I began blending approaches — weaving together cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Internal Family Systems (IFS) with expressive arts, movement, breathwork, and journaling. I started inviting women to paint their inner critic, to write letters to younger versions of themselves, to move their bodies in ways that felt safe and freeing rather than punishing.</p>

          <p>And something remarkable happened. Women who had been stuck for years began to shift. Women who couldn't find the words found the colors, the movements, the metaphors. Women who had been disconnected from their bodies began to come back — slowly, gently, beautifully — to themselves.</p>

          <p>They began to reconnect.</p>

          <h2>Introducing Coming Home to Self</h2>

          <p><strong>Coming Home to Self</strong> is a 12-week online program designed for women who are ready to stop surviving and start living. It was born from everything I've learned in my clinical work, my personal healing journey, and my deep belief that every woman deserves to come home to herself.</p>

          <p>This program is not a course about self-improvement. It's not about fixing what's broken — because you are not broken. It's about remembering who you are beneath the roles, the rules, the expectations, and the armor.</p>

          <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

          <p>Over the course of 12 weeks, you'll be guided through a carefully designed journey that helps you:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Meet your inner parts:</strong> Using principles from Internal Family Systems therapy, you'll learn to identify and compassionately engage with the different parts of yourself — the perfectionist, the people-pleaser, the inner critic, the wounded child, and the wise, grounded Self that has been there all along.</li>
            <li><strong>Shift unhelpful patterns:</strong> Through CBT-informed tools and creative exercises, you'll begin to recognize the thought patterns and behaviors that keep you stuck — and develop new, more compassionate ways of responding to yourself and the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Heal perfectionism and people-pleasing:</strong> These aren't personality traits — they're survival strategies. Together, we'll explore where they came from, honor the protection they once provided, and gently begin to loosen their grip so you can live more freely.</li>
            <li><strong>Reconnect with your creativity, intuition, and truth:</strong> Through expressive arts exercises, somatic practices, and guided journaling, you'll reawaken the creative, intuitive parts of yourself that may have gone quiet. You'll learn to trust your body, your voice, and your inner knowing again.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What's Included</h3>

          <p>The program is designed to be accessible, flexible, and deeply nourishing:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-paced video modules:</strong> Each week includes a video lesson that blends psychoeducation, personal reflection, and guided exercises. Watch on your own schedule, at your own pace.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative prompts:</strong> Art-making, collage, writing, and other expressive exercises designed to help you access insights and emotions that go beyond words.</li>
            <li><strong>Somatic tools:</strong> Breathwork, grounding practices, and gentle movement exercises that help you reconnect with your body and regulate your nervous system.</li>
            <li><strong>Guided journaling:</strong> Thoughtfully crafted prompts that invite you to explore your inner world with curiosity and compassion.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional 1:1 support:</strong> For women who want additional personalized guidance, there is an option to add individual sessions with me throughout the program.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Now?</h2>

          <p>The world doesn't slow down. The demands don't stop. The expectations don't soften. But your nervous system needs you to pause. Your soul needs you to listen. The parts of you that have been silenced need you to finally turn toward them with compassion instead of criticism.</p>

          <p>Too many women are silently struggling — carrying the weight of everyone else's needs while their own go unmet. Too many women have normalized exhaustion, self-abandonment, and disconnection from themselves. Too many women have forgotten what it feels like to be at home in their own skin.</p>

          <p>I created Coming Home to Self because I believe every woman deserves to know what it feels like to live from a place of wholeness rather than depletion. To create from a place of joy rather than obligation. To rest without guilt. To feel without shame. To be — fully, unapologetically, beautifully — themselves.</p>

          <h3>A Message for You</h3>

          <p>If you're reading this and something inside you is stirring — a whisper, a longing, a recognition — I want you to trust that. That stirring is the part of you that already knows: it's time.</p>

          <p>It's time to stop abandoning yourself.</p>
          <p>It's time to stop performing wellness while drowning inside.</p>
          <p>It's time to come home.</p>

          <p><strong>You are not broken. You are healing. You are coming home.</strong></p>
