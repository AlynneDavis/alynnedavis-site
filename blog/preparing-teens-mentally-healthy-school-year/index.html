          <p>As summer winds down and the back-to-school season approaches, many teens and young adults are navigating a mix of excitement, pressure, and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>For some, heading back to school means reconnecting with friends and diving into new interests. For others, it brings a wave of anxiety — about fitting in, keeping up with academics, managing social media comparisons, and dealing with body image pressures that seem to intensify with each passing year.</p>

          <p>As parents, caregivers, and supportive adults, there are meaningful ways you can help the young people in your life prepare — not just with school supplies and schedules, but with emotional tools and grounding practices that support their mental health all year long.</p>

          <h2>1. Start with Emotional Check-Ins, Not Just Supply Lists</h2>

          <p>Before the school year begins, create space for real conversation. Ask your teen how they're feeling about going back — and be prepared to listen without fixing, judging, or minimizing.</p>

          <p>Questions like "What are you most looking forward to?" and "What feels hardest about going back?" can open doors. The goal isn't to have all the answers — it's to let your teen know that their feelings are welcome and valid, whatever they are.</p>

          <p>Help them name their feelings without judgment. Sometimes just having language for what they're experiencing — nervous, overwhelmed, lonely, excited, conflicted — can reduce the intensity of the emotion and increase their sense of control.</p>

          <h3>Creative Tip</h3>

          <p>If your teen struggles to verbalize their feelings, try offering a creative outlet. Journaling — even just a few sentences before bed — can be a powerful way to process emotions. Or try creating a <strong>vision board</strong> together for the school year: what do they want to feel, experience, and create? This shifts the focus from performance to presence, from achievement to alignment.</p>

          <h2>2. Redefine Success</h2>

          <p>Our culture places enormous pressure on teens to achieve — perfect grades, impressive extracurriculars, college-ready resumes. But true success, especially for developing young people, includes so much more than what shows up on a transcript.</p>

          <p>Help your teen understand that true success includes <strong>mental resilience</strong> and <strong>emotional regulation</strong> — the ability to navigate challenges, recover from setbacks, and maintain a sense of self even when things are hard.</p>

          <p>Together, set goals that prioritize well-being alongside academics:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Adequate rest:</strong> Sleep is not a luxury for teens — it's a biological necessity. Help them establish a consistent sleep routine that allows for 8-10 hours per night.</li>
            <li><strong>Nourishment:</strong> Consistent, adequate meals and snacks fuel the brain and stabilize mood. Talk about food as energy and care, not as something to earn or restrict.</li>
            <li><strong>Screen-free breaks:</strong> Build in daily time away from phones and screens — even 20-30 minutes of unstructured, device-free time can significantly reduce anxiety and improve mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Therapy check-ins:</strong> If your teen is already in therapy, maintain the rhythm as school starts. If they're not, consider whether a few sessions might help them build emotional tools before the academic stress ramps up.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Create Calming Rituals</h2>

          <p>Routines ground us — especially during times of transition. Help your teen build small, calming rituals into their day that serve as anchors when everything else feels chaotic.</p>

          <p>Ideas to explore together:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Morning stretches or gentle movement:</strong> Even five minutes of stretching, yoga, or movement before school can help regulate the nervous system and set a calm tone for the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Mindful breathing:</strong> Teach your teen a simple breathing exercise — like box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) — that they can use anywhere: before a test, in the hallway, or when they feel overwhelmed.</li>
            <li><strong>After-school creative outlet:</strong> Whether it's drawing, playing music, dancing in their room, or writing in a journal, having a creative practice after school provides a healthy transition between the demands of the school day and the rest of their evening.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Try a <strong>10-minute doodle or movement break</strong> when they get home. No rules, no goals — just expression. This simple practice can help discharge the stress and overstimulation that accumulates throughout the school day.</p>

          <h2>4. Address Body Image and Eating Concerns Early</h2>

          <p>Back-to-school season often brings heightened comparison — especially in the age of social media. Teens are returning to environments where appearance, body size, and social status feel magnified. For those already struggling with body image, this can be a particularly vulnerable time.</p>

          <p>As someone who specializes in helping teens heal from body image struggles and disordered eating, I want to encourage parents and caregivers to pay attention to the signs — and to trust your instincts if something feels off.</p>

          <p>Watch for changes in:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Eating patterns — skipping meals, eating in secret, new food rules or restrictions</li>
            <li>Body talk — frequent negative comments about their body, comparing themselves to peers or influencers</li>
            <li>Social withdrawal — pulling away from friends, avoiding activities they used to enjoy</li>
            <li>Mood shifts — increased irritability, sadness, or anxiety around mealtimes or social events</li>
            <li>Exercise habits — compulsive or excessive exercise, distress when unable to exercise</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>You don't have to wait until it feels "bad enough" to seek support.</strong> Early intervention is one of the most protective factors in eating disorder recovery. If you're noticing any of these signs, reaching out to a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and body image can make a significant difference.</p>

          <h2>5. Normalize Therapy as Part of Academic Success</h2>

          <p>We hire tutors for math. We sign kids up for sports conditioning. We invest in SAT prep and college counselors. But when it comes to emotional and mental health support, there's often hesitation — as if needing therapy means something is wrong.</p>

          <p>The truth is, therapy supports emotional and mental growth just like tutoring supports academic goals. It's not a sign of failure — it's a sign of wisdom and self-awareness.</p>

          <p>When parents normalize therapy — by talking about it openly, by modeling their own commitment to mental health, by framing it as a strength rather than a last resort — teens are far more likely to seek help when they need it.</p>

          <p>Therapy can help your teen:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Develop healthy coping strategies for academic pressure</li>
            <li>Build emotional intelligence and self-awareness</li>
            <li>Navigate social dynamics and peer relationships</li>
            <li>Process difficult emotions instead of suppressing them</li>
            <li>Strengthen their sense of identity and self-worth</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Think of therapy as part of your teen's overall wellness toolkit — right alongside sleep, nutrition, movement, and connection.</p>

          <h2>Ready to Begin the Year Grounded?</h2>

          <p>If your teen or young adult is heading into the school year carrying more than a backpack — if they're weighed down by anxiety, body image concerns, perfectionism, or emotional overwhelm — I'm here to help.</p>

          <p>Together, we can build a foundation of emotional resilience, creative expression, and self-compassion that supports them not just through the school year, but through life.</p>
