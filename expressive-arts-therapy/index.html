    <!-- What Is Expressive Arts Therapy -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>What Is Expressive Arts Therapy?</h2>
          <p>Expressive arts therapy uses creative modalities — painting, drawing, collage, movement, music, writing, and journaling — to help you process emotions, heal from trauma, and reconnect with who you truly are. It is a therapeutic approach grounded in the understanding that creativity is a fundamental part of being human, and that the act of creating can unlock healing that talk alone cannot reach.</p>
          <p>Rather than asking you to analyze or explain what you feel, expressive arts therapy invites you to <em>express</em> it — through color, texture, rhythm, words on a page, or the movement of your body. The creative process becomes a bridge between your inner world and the insight you need to move forward.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <!-- How It Differs from Talk Therapy -->
    <section class="section section-warm">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>Beyond Traditional Talk Therapy</h2>
          <p>Traditional talk therapy relies primarily on cognitive processing — using words and logic to understand your experiences. While this can be powerful, it doesn't always reach the places where pain, trauma, and emotion live in the body.</p>
          <p>Expressive arts therapy engages your whole self: the creative brain, the body, the nervous system, and the parts of you that think in images, sensations, and metaphors rather than sentences. When trauma is stored in the body, creative expression offers a way to access and release it that verbal processing alone may not provide.</p>
          <p>This is not about replacing talk therapy — it is about expanding the toolbox. In our work together, I integrate expressive arts with evidence-based approaches including CBT, Internal Family Systems (IFS), and somatic awareness to create a holistic, personalized therapeutic experience.</p>

    <!-- Benefits -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>Benefits of Expressive Arts Therapy</h2>
          <p>Creative expression in a therapeutic container can open doors that have felt locked for years. Clients who engage in expressive arts therapy often experience meaningful shifts in how they relate to themselves and their emotions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-grid fade-in">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Process Emotions Without Judgment</h3>
            <p>Art and creative expression give your feelings a place to land without the pressure of finding the "right" words. You can explore difficult emotions in a way that feels safe, contained, and entirely your own.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Access Insights Beyond Verbal Thinking</h3>
            <p>Some of your deepest wisdom lives beneath conscious thought. Creative modalities help you tap into intuition, body knowledge, and subconscious patterns that talk therapy may not reach on its own.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Reconnect with Joy, Play, and Self-Expression</h3>
            <p>Many women have learned to suppress their creative impulses, their playfulness, and their authentic voice. Expressive arts therapy creates space to rediscover those parts of yourself — gently and without expectation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Regulate the Nervous System</h3>
            <p>Rhythmic, sensory, and embodied creative practices — like drawing, collage, or movement — can calm an activated nervous system, reduce anxiety, and help you build greater capacity for emotional regulation over time.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Collage</h3>
            <p>Piece together images, textures, and words to create visual narratives, explore identity, or map out the relationship between different parts of yourself.</p>

          <h2>Who Expressive Arts Therapy Helps</h2>
          <p>Expressive arts therapy can be especially powerful for women who feel stuck, disconnected, or exhausted by patterns they can't seem to break. You may benefit from this approach if you are navigating:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trauma and PTSD</strong> — processing painful experiences that feel too big for words</li>
            <li><strong>Eating disorders and body image struggles</strong> — rebuilding your relationship with your body through compassion and creativity</li>
            <li><strong>Anxiety and depression</strong> — finding new pathways through emotional overwhelm</li>
            <li><strong>ADHD</strong> — working with your brain instead of against it through engaging, multi-sensory approaches</li>
            <li><strong>Life transitions</strong> — navigating change, loss, motherhood, career shifts, or identity questions</li>
            <li><strong>Perfectionism and people-pleasing</strong> — releasing the need to perform and reconnecting with your authentic self</li>
          </ul>

    <!-- You Don't Need to Be Artistic -->
    <section class="section section-warm">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>You Don't Need to Be "Artistic"</h2>
          <p>This is one of the most important things I want you to know: expressive arts therapy is about the <em>process</em>, not the product. You do not need any artistic skill, training, or talent. There is no right or wrong way to create in this space.</p>
          <p>The value is not in making something beautiful — it is in what emerges as you create. The colors you choose, the way your hand moves across the page, the words that surface when you stop editing yourself — all of it carries meaning and becomes material for our therapeutic work together.</p>
          <p>Many of my clients tell me they haven't picked up a paintbrush since childhood. That is perfectly okay. In fact, reconnecting with that unfiltered, uncritical creative energy you had as a child is often part of the healing itself.</p>

    <!-- How Sessions Work -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <div class="content-section fade-in">
          <h2>How Sessions Work</h2>
          <p>Every expressive arts therapy session is a gentle, guided exploration within a safe therapeutic container. Here is what you can expect:</p>
          <h3>Check-In and Grounding</h3>
          <p>We begin each session by checking in with how you are feeling — in your body, your emotions, and your mind. I may guide you through a brief grounding or mindfulness exercise to help you arrive fully in the space.</p>
          <h3>Creative Exploration</h3>
          <p>Based on what surfaces during check-in and where you are in your therapeutic journey, I will offer a creative invitation — a prompt, a material, a modality. You are always free to follow your own instincts. There is no pressure to create anything specific.</p>
          <h3>Reflection and Integration</h3>
          <p>After the creative process, we take time to reflect on what emerged. This is where the therapeutic insight often deepens — as we explore the images, words, movements, or feelings that came up during the creative work.</p>
          <h3>Integration with Evidence-Based Approaches</h3>
          <p>Throughout our work, I weave in techniques from CBT, Internal Family Systems, and somatic awareness to ensure that creative insights translate into real, lasting change in your daily life.</p>
