          <h2>You Didn't Choose This — and You Don't Have to Navigate It Alone</h2>
          <p>Eating disorders are among the most misunderstood mental health conditions. They are not about vanity, willpower, or a phase someone will outgrow. They are serious, complex conditions rooted in a deep need for safety, control, or relief from emotional pain. Behind every food rule, every binge, every moment of body checking is a person trying to cope with something that feels too big to hold alone.</p>
          <p>If you or someone you love is struggling with disordered eating, I want you to know: this is not your fault, and recovery is genuinely possible. As a specialized eating disorder therapist in Charlotte, NC, I work with adolescents, adults, and families to untangle the behaviors, beliefs, and experiences that keep eating disorders in place — and to build something more sustainable and life-giving in their place.</p>

        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>Eating Disorder Specializations</h2>
          <p>I work with a wide range of eating and body image concerns, including:</p>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Binge Eating Disorder</h3>
            <p>Binge eating often develops as a way to manage stress, numb difficult emotions, or cope with restriction. Therapy focuses on understanding the cycle, addressing emotional triggers, and developing a more attuned, compassionate relationship with food and hunger.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Bulimia Nervosa</h3>
            <p>Bulimia is frequently driven by shame, perfectionism, and a desperate need to undo perceived mistakes. Recovery involves interrupting the binge-purge cycle while addressing the underlying beliefs about worthiness, control, and self-image that sustain it.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder)</h3>
            <p>ARFID goes beyond picky eating. It can involve intense anxiety around certain textures, fears of choking or vomiting, or a genuine lack of interest in food. I work with both adolescents and adults to gently expand comfort with food in a way that respects their nervous system and pace.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Orthorexia</h3>
            <p>When "healthy eating" becomes compulsive, rigid, and all-consuming, it stops being about health. Orthorexia often masks perfectionism, anxiety, or a need for control. Therapy helps loosen the grip of food rules and reconnect with a more flexible, joyful way of nourishing yourself.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Body Image Distortion and Body Shame</h3>
            <p>Body image struggles do not always come with a diagnosable eating disorder, but they can still dominate your life — affecting what you wear, where you go, how present you can be, and how you relate to others. I help clients develop a more grounded, honest relationship with their body that makes room for acceptance and self-compassion.</p>

    <!-- How Eating Disorders Develop -->

      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>How Eating Disorders Develop</h2>
          <p>There is no single cause of an eating disorder. Most often, they emerge from a combination of factors that converge at a vulnerable time in someone's life:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trauma and adverse experiences</strong> — including childhood neglect, emotional abuse, sexual trauma, bullying, or medical trauma. The body remembers what the mind may try to forget, and eating behaviors often become a way to manage that stored pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Perfectionism and high achievement</strong> — many people with eating disorders are high-functioning and driven. The same traits that earn praise in school or work can fuel relentless self-criticism and impossible standards around food and body.</li>
            <li><strong>A need for control</strong> — when life feels chaotic, unpredictable, or unsafe, controlling food can feel like the one thing within your power. Over time, what begins as a coping strategy becomes its own source of distress.</li>
            <li><strong>Diet culture and societal messaging</strong> — the constant cultural pressure to shrink, restrict, and earn your worth through appearance creates fertile ground for disordered eating, especially when layered with other vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Family dynamics and attachment patterns</strong> — how you learned to express needs, manage emotions, and relate to caregivers all shape your relationship with food and your body.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Understanding how your eating disorder developed is not about assigning blame. It is about making sense of your story so you can begin to write a different chapter.</p>

    <!-- Signs It May Be Time to Seek Help -->
    <section class="section section-warm" aria-label="Signs you may need eating disorder therapy">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>Signs It May Be Time to Seek Help</h2>
          <p>Eating disorders are skilled at hiding in plain sight. You may not recognize how deeply food and body concerns have taken hold until the cost becomes impossible to ignore. It may be time to reach out if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You spend a significant portion of your day thinking about food, calories, weight, or your body</li>
            <li>You feel out of control around food — eating past fullness, restricting heavily, or cycling between the two</li>
            <li>You avoid social situations, travel, or events because of anxiety about food or how you look</li>
            <li>You use exercise, purging, laxatives, or restriction to compensate for eating</li>
            <li>Your child or teen has changed their eating patterns, lost or gained weight suddenly, or become withdrawn around meals</li>
            <li>You feel trapped in food rules that once felt manageable but now run your life</li>
            <li>Your physical health is suffering — fatigue, digestive issues, hair loss, dizziness, or loss of your menstrual cycle</li>
            <li>You feel ashamed, secretive, or isolated because of your relationship with food</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>If any of this resonates, you are not broken — and you are not alone.</strong> These patterns developed for a reason, and with the right support, they can change.</p>

    <!-- My Approach -->
    <section class="section" aria-label="Therapeutic approach to eating disorders">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>My Approach to Eating Disorder Therapy</h2>
          <p>I believe eating disorder recovery requires more than behavioral change — it requires understanding why the eating disorder exists and what it has been protecting you from. My approach is trauma-informed, relationally grounded, and tailored to each person's unique story.</p>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>CBT-E (Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)</h3>
            <p>CBT-E is the leading evidence-based treatment for eating disorders. It addresses the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that maintain disordered eating — including perfectionism, low self-esteem, mood intolerance, and interpersonal difficulties. CBT-E provides structure and practical tools while making space for deeper exploration of the factors driving the eating disorder.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Expressive Arts Therapy</h3>
            <p>Words are not always enough — especially when it comes to body image, shame, and trauma. Expressive arts therapy uses creative modalities like visual art, movement, music, and writing to access parts of your experience that live beyond language. This approach is particularly powerful for reconnecting with your body as a source of wisdom rather than something to control or punish.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Nutrition-Informed Care</h3>
            <p>While I am not a dietitian, my work is informed by nutritional understanding and I collaborate closely with registered dietitians when appropriate. I believe in supporting the whole person — body and mind — and ensuring that therapy and nutrition care work together toward the same goals.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Family Involvement</h3>
            <p>For adolescents and teens, family support is often essential to recovery. I work with parents and caregivers to help them understand the eating disorder, respond effectively at mealtimes, and rebuild connection during a time that can feel frightening and confusing for the entire family.</p>

    <!-- What Sessions Look Like -->
    <section class="section section-warm" aria-label="What eating disorder therapy sessions look like">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>What Therapy Sessions Look Like</h2>
          <p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to eating disorder therapy. What sessions look like will depend on where you are in your journey, your specific challenges, and what feels safe and productive for you. However, here is a general sense of what to expect:</p>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Building Safety and Understanding</h3>
            <p>We begin by getting to know your story — not just the eating behaviors, but the experiences, relationships, and beliefs that shaped them. This phase is about establishing trust, understanding your patterns, and creating a shared roadmap for the work ahead.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Addressing Behaviors and Building Skills</h3>
            <p>Together, we work on interrupting harmful cycles — whether that means challenging food rules, developing alternative coping strategies, or learning to tolerate discomfort without turning to restriction or bingeing. This is where CBT-E tools are especially useful.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Processing Deeper Layers</h3>
            <p>As safety and stability grow, we explore the trauma, grief, shame, or relational wounds that fueled the eating disorder. This is where expressive arts therapy often becomes a powerful resource — helping you process what words alone cannot reach.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Rebuilding and Sustaining Recovery</h3>
            <p>Recovery is not a destination — it is a practice. We work together to strengthen your identity beyond the eating disorder, deepen your relationship with yourself and others, and develop a plan for navigating challenges that may arise after therapy ends.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>Recovery Is Possible</h2>
          <p>Recovery from an eating disorder is not about achieving perfection around food or your body. It is about rebuilding trust — trust with your body, trust with yourself, and trust that you can navigate life without the eating disorder as your safety net.</p>
          <p>It means being able to eat without rules dictating every choice. It means being present at a meal with people you love without calculating or compensating. It means looking in the mirror and seeing a whole person, not a collection of flaws. It means having hard days and knowing you can get through them without punishing your body.</p>
          <p><strong>Recovery is not linear, and it is not easy — but it is real, and I have seen it happen again and again.</strong> With the right support, at the right pace, people do recover. Families do heal. A different relationship with food and your body is genuinely within reach.</p>
