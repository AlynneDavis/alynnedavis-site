            <h2>A Therapist Who Understands What It Takes to Heal</h2>
            <p>I'm Alynne Davis, a licensed clinical mental health counselor (LCMHC) with more than nine years of clinical experience supporting women through some of the most challenging seasons of their lives. I specialize in eating disorders, trauma, ADHD, body image, and women's mental health — and I bring both clinical depth and genuine warmth to every session.</p>
            <p>My practice is rooted in the belief that healing happens in relationship — with a therapist who sees you clearly, holds space without judgment, and trusts your capacity to grow. I blend evidence-based approaches like <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong> and <strong>Internal Family Systems (IFS)</strong> with the creative power of <strong>expressive arts therapy</strong>, including painting, movement, journaling, and music.</p>
            <p>I work with women in Charlotte, NC and throughout North Carolina and South Carolina through both in-person and virtual sessions.</p>

        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>My Philosophy: Safety First, Then Healing</h2>
          <p>I believe that before any real change can happen, you need to feel safe. Not just physically safe, but emotionally safe — safe enough to be honest, to feel your feelings, and to let your guard down without fear of being judged or rushed.</p>
          <p>Many of the women I work with have spent years managing, achieving, and holding it all together. Therapy with me is an invitation to stop performing and start listening — to the parts of yourself that have been silenced, ignored, or pushed aside in the name of survival.</p>
          <p><strong>My approach is body-centered, relational, and paced to support safety and self-trust.</strong> We move at the speed of your nervous system, not an arbitrary treatment timeline. I pay close attention to what your body is communicating, what your emotions are trying to protect, and what your inner experience is telling us about what you need right now.</p>

    <!-- Training & Approach -->
    <section class="section" aria-label="Training and therapeutic approach">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>Clinical Training and Approach</h2>
          <p>Over nine years of clinical practice, I have developed an integrative approach that draws from multiple evidence-based modalities to meet each client where they are.</p>

          <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
          <p>CBT helps identify and reframe the thought patterns and beliefs that keep you stuck — the inner critic that says you're not enough, the rigid rules around food or productivity, or the catastrophic thinking that fuels anxiety. I use CBT as a practical foundation for building healthier coping strategies and challenging distorted self-perceptions.</p>

          <h3>Internal Family Systems (IFS)</h3>
          <p>IFS offers a compassionate framework for understanding the different "parts" within you — the protector who keeps you busy, the perfectionist who drives you to exhaustion, or the inner child who carries old pain. Rather than fighting these parts, we learn to listen to them with curiosity and help them release the burdens they've been carrying.</p>

          <h3>Expressive Arts Therapy</h3>
          <p>Not everything can be said in words. Expressive arts therapy uses painting, movement, journaling, music, and other creative modalities to access emotions and experiences that talk therapy alone may not reach. This is not about being "artistic" — it's about giving your inner world a voice through whatever medium feels right for you.</p>

          <h3>Body-Centered and Somatic Awareness</h3>
          <p>Trauma lives in the body, and so does healing. I bring a somatic awareness to our work together, helping you tune into physical sensations, nervous system responses, and embodied emotions. This is especially important for women navigating eating disorders, body image struggles, and trauma — where the relationship between mind and body has been disrupted.</p>

    <!-- Specializations Section -->
    <section class="section section-warm" aria-label="Areas of specialization">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header fade-in">
          <h2>Areas of Specialization</h2>
          <p>I focus my clinical work on the issues that affect women most deeply — and that are too often misunderstood, minimized, or treated with a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-grid fade-in">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Eating Disorders</h3>
            <p>Specialized treatment for binge eating disorder, bulimia, ARFID, orthorexia, and disordered eating patterns. I understand the complexity of food, control, and identity — and I approach recovery with compassion and clinical expertise.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Trauma and PTSD</h3>
            <p>Trauma-informed therapy for women carrying the weight of childhood experiences, relational trauma, or complex PTSD. We work at a pace that honors your nervous system and builds genuine safety from the inside out.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>ADHD in Women</h3>
            <p>ADHD in women often goes undiagnosed or is masked by anxiety, perfectionism, and people-pleasing. I help women understand their ADHD, develop self-compassion, and build strategies that work with their brain rather than against it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Body Image</h3>
            <p>Healing your relationship with your body is central to healing your relationship with yourself. I support women in moving from body shame and self-monitoring toward embodiment, acceptance, and trust.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Women's Mental Health</h3>
            <p>From perinatal mood disorders to life transitions, perfectionism, and identity struggles — I understand the unique pressures women face and offer a space to process, heal, and grow without performing or pretending.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Expressive Arts</h3>
            <p>Creative modalities including painting, movement, journaling, and music offer pathways to healing that words alone cannot reach. No artistic experience is needed — just a willingness to explore.</p>

          <h2>What Working With Me Looks Like</h2>
          <p>When you sit across from me — whether in person in Charlotte or through a screen — you'll find someone who is fully present, genuinely curious about your experience, and unafraid to be real with you. I don't hide behind clinical distance. I believe the therapeutic relationship is the foundation of healing, and I take that seriously.</p>
          <p>I will meet you where you are. If you need structure, we'll build it. If you need permission to slow down, I'll hold that space. If you need someone to gently challenge a pattern that's keeping you stuck, I'll do that with care and honesty.</p>
          <p><strong>You don't need to have it all figured out before reaching out.</strong> Many of my clients come in unsure of what they need — and that's perfectly okay. The first step is simply showing up.</p>
