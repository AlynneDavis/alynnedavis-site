          <h2>When Holding It Together Stops Working</h2>
          <p>Many women come to therapy not in obvious crisis, but after years of quietly managing everything — their households, their careers, other people's emotions, and their own pain. From the outside, it may look like you have it all under control. But underneath the surface, you may feel exhausted, disconnected, anxious, or like you are slowly disappearing into the roles you play for everyone else.</p>
          <p>You might notice that the strategies you have always relied on — staying busy, being the strong one, controlling what you eat, avoiding conflict, pushing through — are no longer holding. The anxiety is louder. The fatigue goes deeper. The numbness is harder to shake.</p>
          <p><strong>This is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign that your nervous system is asking for something different.</strong> What once protected you is now keeping you stuck, and therapy can help you find a way forward that does not require you to keep shrinking or performing to survive.</p>

    <!-- A Body-Centered, Relational Approach -->
    <section class="section section-warm" aria-label="Body-centered relational healing approach">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>A Body-Centered, Relational Approach to Healing</h2>
          <p>Trauma does not live only in your thoughts or memories — it lives in your body. It shows up as tension you carry in your shoulders, the tightness in your chest before a difficult conversation, the way you hold your breath without realizing it, or the chronic fatigue that no amount of sleep seems to resolve. That is why healing from trauma requires more than understanding what happened to you. It requires reconnecting with your body as a source of information, safety, and wisdom.</p>
          <p>My approach to therapy is relational and body-centered. This means we pay close attention to what is happening in your body during our sessions — not to override or fix those sensations, but to listen to them with curiosity and compassion. Over time, this builds a different kind of relationship with yourself: one where you can trust your own signals, tolerate discomfort without shutting down, and feel genuinely at home in your own skin.</p>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Nervous System Regulation and Safety</h3>
            <p>Trauma disrupts the nervous system's ability to regulate. You may find yourself stuck in states of hypervigilance — always scanning for danger, never fully relaxing — or in shutdown mode, feeling flat, disconnected, or unable to access your emotions. A central part of our work together is helping your nervous system learn that safety is possible, not just as a concept but as a felt experience in your body. We do this gradually, at a pace that respects where you are, using tools grounded in somatic awareness and co-regulation within the therapeutic relationship.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>What We Work On Together</h2>
          <p>The women I work with come to therapy with a wide range of experiences and concerns. What they share in common is a desire to stop performing and start living — to feel more connected to themselves, more honest in their relationships, and more grounded in their own lives.</p>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Healing from Toxic Relationships and Codependency</h3>
            <p>If you have spent years in a relationship that left you questioning your reality, walking on eggshells, or losing yourself in someone else's needs, the effects do not disappear when the relationship ends. Toxic relationships — including those involving covert narcissism, emotional manipulation, or chronic invalidation — reshape the way you see yourself and what you believe you deserve. Therapy helps you untangle those distortions, rebuild trust in your own perceptions, and learn what healthy relationships actually look and feel like from the inside.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Codependency and People-Pleasing</h3>
            <p>Codependency is not a character flaw — it is an adaptive response to environments where your needs were not prioritized, where love felt conditional, or where you learned that your worth depended on what you could do for others. In therapy, we explore where these patterns began, how they show up now, and what it looks like to begin prioritizing your own needs without guilt or shame.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Grief, Loss, and Life Transitions</h3>
            <p>Grief does not only follow death. It follows divorce, the end of a friendship, the loss of a version of yourself you thought you would become. It accompanies major life transitions — becoming a mother, navigating an empty nest, shifting careers, moving to a new city, or leaving a marriage. These experiences deserve space and witness, not just the expectation that you will adjust and move on. Therapy provides a place to honor what has been lost while discovering what is emerging.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Perinatal Mood Disorders and Postpartum Depression</h3>
            <p>Becoming a mother is often portrayed as purely joyful, but the reality can include overwhelming anxiety, deep sadness, rage, numbness, intrusive thoughts, or a painful sense of disconnection from your baby. Perinatal mood disorders are more common than most people realize, and they are not a reflection of how much you love your child. They are a sign that your brain and body need support during one of the most demanding transitions of your life. I offer a safe, nonjudgmental space to process what you are experiencing and to find your way back to yourself during this vulnerable time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Perfectionism, Control, and Self-Worth</h3>
            <p>For many women, perfectionism is not just a personality trait — it is a survival strategy. If you learned early on that love, safety, or acceptance depended on achievement, appearance, or being "good enough," those patterns can become deeply ingrained. Therapy helps you examine the cost of perfectionism, develop self-compassion, and begin to build a sense of worth that is not contingent on performance.</p>

    <!-- Expressive Arts -->

          <h2>Expressive Arts: Healing Beyond Talk Therapy</h2>
          <p>Talk therapy is valuable — but it has limits. Some of the most painful experiences you carry may not have words yet. They may live as images, sensations, or emotions that surface without explanation. Expressive arts therapy provides a way to access and process these experiences through creative modalities — visual art, movement, music, poetry, and other forms of creative expression.</p>
          <p>You do not need to be artistic or creative to benefit from this approach. Expressive arts therapy is not about making something beautiful. It is about giving form to what lives inside you so it can be seen, understood, and ultimately integrated. Many women find that expressive arts help them access parts of their experience that years of talking never quite reached.</p>
          <p>In our sessions, creative exploration is always optional and always guided by what feels safe and resonant for you. Some clients engage with art-making regularly; others use it occasionally when words feel insufficient. There is no right way to do this work — only your way.</p>

    <!-- Therapeutic Approach -->
    <section class="section" aria-label="Integrated therapeutic approach">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>An Integrated Approach to Women's Therapy</h2>
          <p>I do not believe in one-size-fits-all therapy. The women I work with are complex, and their healing deserves an approach that honors that complexity. My work integrates several evidence-based and experiential modalities, tailored to what each person needs:</p>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
            <p>CBT helps identify and challenge the thought patterns that keep you stuck — the inner critic that says you are not enough, the catastrophic thinking that fuels anxiety, or the beliefs about yourself that were written by someone else's treatment of you. CBT provides practical, grounded tools for shifting these patterns in daily life.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Internal Family Systems (IFS)</h3>
            <p>IFS is a compassionate framework that recognizes the different parts within you — the part that pushes you to achieve, the part that wants to withdraw, the part that carries old pain. Rather than trying to silence or override these parts, IFS helps you develop a curious, caring relationship with all of them. This approach is especially powerful for women who feel internally conflicted, self-critical, or disconnected from their own needs.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Somatic Awareness</h3>
            <p>Because trauma is stored in the body, healing must include the body. Somatic awareness practices help you tune into physical sensations, understand what your nervous system is communicating, and develop the capacity to stay present with difficult emotions without being overwhelmed. This is not about forcing anything — it is about gently expanding your window of tolerance over time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Expressive Arts Therapy</h3>
            <p>As described above, expressive arts therapy offers pathways to healing that go beyond language. Whether through visual art, movement, writing, or other creative forms, this modality helps you access, express, and integrate experiences that talk therapy alone may not reach.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- The Therapeutic Relationship -->
    <section class="section section-warm" aria-label="The therapeutic relationship">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content-narrow fade-in">
          <h2>The Therapeutic Relationship as a Foundation for Healing</h2>
          <p>Research consistently shows that the quality of the therapeutic relationship is the strongest predictor of positive outcomes in therapy — more than any specific technique or modality. For women who have experienced relational trauma, betrayal, or chronic invalidation, this is especially significant. The relationship between therapist and client becomes a place to practice something different: being seen without judgment, expressing needs without punishment, and experiencing honesty and consistency in a relationship.</p>
          <p>I bring my full self to our work together — warm, direct, honest, and genuinely invested in your growth. I will not pretend to have all the answers or rush you toward a version of healing that does not feel authentic. What I will do is show up consistently, hold space for the full range of your experience, and walk alongside you as you rediscover who you are beneath the roles, the coping, and the performance.</p>
          <p>Therapy is not about becoming a different person. It is about coming home to the person you already are — the one who has been waiting beneath the armor all along.</p>
